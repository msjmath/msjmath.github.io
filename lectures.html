<div class="post-title">Godel's Incompleteness Theorem!<span class="post-author">~Austin</span></div>
<div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
<span class="post-content">
Godel’s incompleteness theorem is a fundamental result in model theory, 
and has many philosophical implications (a lot of which result from 
misinterpretations). Godel’s incompleteness theorem is often considered 
the most profound and elegant proof in all of mathematics [[citation needed]]. 
Since the full proof itself is somewhat too difficult to cover in one lecture, 
we will give an outline of the most important and difficult to understand points 
(since the details are comparatively trivial).

<div class="post-title">Transfinite Cardinals<span class="post-author">~Austin</span></div>

<span class="post-content">
We talked about all the different types of infinities! We went over diagonalization, bijection, and other proof methods related to cardinals! 
We showed how the set of real numbers is infinitely larger than the set of rational numbers, and how the set integers
is exactly as large as the set of rationals <br/> <a href="pdf/cardinal.pdf">(click here for pdf)</a></span>

<div class="post-title">Mass Points<span class="post-author">~Alvin</span></div>
<div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
<span class="post-content">
Mass points is a technique that simplifies the process of finding ratios between lengths of segments in a
geometric problem, and it is actually based on the concept of torque (from physics). Problems that use mass
points can usually be solved using similar triangles, area ratios, or vector bashing, but mass points gives us
a cleaner, faster solution. <br/> <a href="pdf/mass.pdf">(click here for pdf)</a></span>

<div class="post-title">Modular Arithmetic<span class="post-author">~Austin</span></div>
<div class="spacer">&nbsp;</div>
<span class="post-content">
Modular Arithmetic is a topic in number theory that concerns the remainders resulting from division. 
Euler's totient theorem gives us a powerful tool to use when dealing modular arithmetic with exponents.

<div class="post-title">Stable Marriage<span class="post-author">~Alvin</span></div>

<span class="post-content">
N single men and N single women are desperate to get married, and they need your advice as
to how to pair up. Each person has ranked the members of the opposite gender in order of who they want
their partner to be. How do you make everyone as happy as possible, or at least create a
stable arrangement?

<span class="post-content">
Problems involving counting the number of ways to choose something come up frequently
on math competitions like the AMC's and AIME's. The combinations function and its uses is one of the 
fundamentals of combinatorics.<br/>

<span class="post-content">
Vieta's Formulas (also called Viete's Formulae) are a quick way to determine the sum, product, etc. of the
roots of a polynomial. They are closely related to the symmetric polynomials, which form and entry point 
into Galois theory and some topics in modern algebra.<br/>
